A production-grade machine learning project that predicts the probability of U.S. flight delays.  
Built for real-world deployment with a focus on **scalability, security, and maintainability**.

## Why this project
- **Business impact:** Anticipate delays to improve scheduling and customer satisfaction.
- **Engineering value:** End-to-end ML: data → features → model → metrics → deploy.
- **Recruiter insight:** Cloud-native ML with security-conscious design.
