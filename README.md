## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **how to take a Machine Learning model from concept to deployment** in a cloud-native environment.  
It predicts whether a U.S. domestic flight will arrive late based on historical flight data, weather conditions, and carrier information.

✅ **Business Relevance:** Airlines, logistics, and travel platforms can integrate this model to optimize operations and improve customer satisfaction.  
✅ **Engineering Focus:** Built for **maintainability, automation, and scalability**.
