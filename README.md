# ✈️ Flight Delay Risk — ML to Cloud
[![CI](https://github.com/saidnoor-bot/aws-sagemaker-flight-delays/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/saidnoor-bot/aws-sagemaker-flight-delays/actions/workflows/ci.yml) ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)

A production-grade machine learning project that predicts the probability of U.S. flight delays.  
Built for real-world deployment with a focus on **scalability, security, and maintainability**.

## Why this project
- **Business impact:** Anticipate delays to improve scheduling and customer satisfaction.
- **Engineering value:** End-to-end ML: data → features → model → metrics → deploy.
- **Recruiter insight:** Cloud-native ML with security-conscious design.
